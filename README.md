### Disclaimer: 
This repo whilst only recently pushed to github is quite old now so the stack
might not be quite what you're after if you're just starting out with node/express.  In the
'What you might learn section', as of Jan 2017 for the development workflow you might want to take a look at webpack.

### What is this site?
A simple express website I built to host the 
last image captured by my Raspberry Pi security webcam.  This allows 
me to view it over the net on various devices with limited internet
bandwith.

### Seriously?  You built a website just for that?
No not really.  It's just one of the many sites I've built whilst getting up to speed with the [node](http://nodejs.org) 
and [expressjs](http://expressjs.com) stacks.

Yes of course it's totally over the top for what it does but when I'm brushing up on a new stack I can
focus better when there is a purpose to what I'm building.  Let's
be honest, does the world really need another TODO app?

### Can I use the live site?
Sorry, no.  The image(s) are only of my front driveway anyway.  Plus, if I let everyone in there wouldn't have been much point in my learning 
[passportjs](http://www.passportjs.com).

### Can I get the source code?
Absolutely.  <del>It's available on [github](http://www.github.com/daxaar/picam)</del>.  You're looking at it.

### What might I learn from the source?
- express routing
- multiple passportjs strategy usage
- jade
- development workflow using
  - gulp
  - browser-sync
  - node-mon
- jade has been renamed to pug (stupid name)
- development workflow
  - webpack!
